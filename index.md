"Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation"  
-Dean Kamen

I was fascinated by the idea of giving machines human like visual capabilties, and ever since then my research interest lies around in computer vision. Now Im a PhD student in Visual AI in Robotics at University of Leeds, working with  <a href="http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~cenrf/"  style="color: black">Dr. Raul Fuentes</a> and <a href="https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/staff/84/Professor_David_Hogg" style="color: black"> Prof. David Hogg</a>.
My research topic is observation learning in robotics.
